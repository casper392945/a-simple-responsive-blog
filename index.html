                I know, I know. You might be thinking about why did I choose such a title for a blog post. Responsive height design, seriously? Well, the term Responsive Web Design is often known as checking the browser on multiple viewport widths and device sizes. We always test horizontally by reducing the width, but I rarely see some consideration for testing vertically by reducing the browser height. There’s a question in the back of your mind: Do we need to reduce the browser height? Yes, and I will convince you in this article.
                When we work on a website implementation, making assumptions without depending on real-world data is not good. Taking responsibility for testing both horizontally and vertically is extremely important.

                If you’re familiar with CSS, you probably know all about the box-shadow property. But did you know there is a CSS filter, drop-shadow, that does something similar? Like box-shadow, we can pass in values for x-offset, y-offset, blur radius and colour...

                People seem to be fascinated by construction machines. Watching them is so much fun that people won’t mind getting dangerously close to them just to get a glimpse.
                You can greatly enhance our web page engagement rates in the same way that moving machines capture our attention.
                <br>
                We, designers/developers, all share the desire of grabbing the attention of our website visitors and getting them to engagement. Here at JotForm, we’ve found that we get close to achieving this goal by creating simpler user interfaces and by making our pages load fast. But we also continue to ask ourselves, “What can we do to stand out and create a more delightful user experience?” and our biggest tool in this goal has been CSS animations.
                <br>
                CSS-only animations work much better compare to Javascript based DOM-manipulation animations. The biggest advantage is that CSS’s ability to apply universal changes and increased support by more and more browsers.

                I discovered CSS about a decade ago while trying to modify the look of a blog I had created. Pretty soon, I was able to code cool things with more mathematical and, therefore, easier-to-understand features like transforms. However, other areas of CSS, such as layout, have remained a constant source of pain.
                <br>
                This post is about a problem I encountered about a decade ago and, until recently, did not know how to solve in a smart way. Specifically, it’s about how I found a solution to a long-running problem using a modern CSS grid technique that, in the process, gave me even cooler results than I originally imagined.</p>

                Imagine a user stuck with indecision when they encounter a pair of buttons on your interface. The user looks to the left one and then to the right one, comparing them. After doing some thinking, they make a selection. Their selection not only comes late, but they’re also uncertain about it because your buttons don’t have a strong hierarchy.
                <br>
                To establish a strong button hierarchy, avoid the following common color contrast mistakes that designers make. Use an online color calculator based on the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) color contrast formula to assess contrast levels. </p>

                Type a CSS property name into the box above. The page will automatically update as you type.<br>
                Add a space after the full property name to avoid multiple results for certain keywords (e.g. "width ").<br>
                Each property has a "Load Browser Support" button. The loaded CanIUse data represents basic support for the property itself and doesn't include each possible value or context (e.g. flex vs. grid context). No support data? That means there is no MDN article (feel free to create one!).<br>
                Try some of the pre-defined filters in the navigation above. All selected or typed filters will display the filtered properties in a menu on the right.<br>
                This app is now installable as a PWA!<br>
                The first value listed is the initial/default value for that property.<br>
                Values in angle brackets (e.g. <length>) are linked to the spec, where it describes how they're written.<br>

              <p class="mbr-text mbr-fonts-style display-7">Animations on the internet are not new. They have been used to achieve many goals, including making something more interesting to watch or even more appealing. Sometimes that is what makes a website stand out among the competition! Animations can make UI elements resemble the real world, making them smoothly change while giving the feeling of continuity, action and progress, instead of changing in a blink of an eye.
                <br>
                Even when applied to small elements, animations can help the user remember whether an action was executed or not. In fact, the user is more likely to remember what he/she just did after perceiving something changing little by little, instead of all at once. A simple animation for a loading screen tells more than just waiting with a white page. It’s the difference between knowing something is still happening and wondering if the page is broken.</p>

            <div class="fadeout">
              <p class="mbr-text mbr-fonts-style display-7">Cascading Style Sheets or CSS as it's usually referred to as forms the backbone of the modern web. Like HTML is responsible for structure, and JavaScript for interactive features, CSS handles all the styling, making your website look as gorgeous as it does.
                <br>
                Now, even though CSS is not a programming language (deal with it), there's still a learning curve associated with it. Especially in recent years, I'd argue that CSS features have grown to such an extent that it's no longer sustainable to use it without some "googling", autocompletion, or another source of reference.
                <br>
                Among those growing features of CSS is its unit system. Long gone are times of "pixel-perfect" designs utilizing px unit, and in are the relative ones, allowing developers to create responsive designs for the plethora of form factors of modern devices.
                <br>
                So today, I'd like to stick to the basics a little bit and guide you through all the CSS units, explain what they mean, how they work, as well as their cross-browser support and some of my personal reflections on them. Hope you find it useful. Let's dive in!</p>

                <br>
                Coming up with a domain name for a website can be hard. With so many top-level domains already accounted for, it can be hard to find one that fits with what you want to create. First, you have to think of an original name. Then you have to figure out if your idea is open and available for you to buy.
                <br>
                Many common domain names have been taken. But don’t let this discourage you. Business name generators and domain name search apps let you see what names are open, and can give you options that would have been hard to brainstorm on your own.</p>

                With the addition of some new CSS properties in the last few years, frontend developers can now create interesting text visuals much easier. "Knockout" or "cutout" text, where words clip a background image, gradient or video, are possible with very little code.
                <br>
                In this article, we'll explore five CSS text masking and clipping techniques using the background-clip and clip-path properties.

                While building websites, there are many cases where we want to make sure if a design component will work under different conditions. The just in case mindset aims to educate designers and developers to think ahead of time of some possible failure scenarios for a component. I called it just in case because that’s literally what it means. Just in case the title got longer, do this. Just in case this element has a sibling next to it, do that. It’s all about accounting for some edge cases.
                <br>
                In this article, I will discuss some common design use-cases, and how to handle them just in case the content got longer or different than what’s expected. You’re in for a treat, let’s dive in!

                Someone wrote in to me asking how to create a simple bar navigation with icons. This is a pretty simple layout thing that could be accomplished loads of different ways. List items as inline-block probably makes the most sense in general.
                <br>
                But I’ve been enjoying tinkering with flexbox, so I decided to toss it together with that, and it made for a pretty educational example I think.

                Centering things in CSS is the poster child of CSS complaining. Why does it have to be so hard? They jeer. I think the issue isn’t that it’s difficult to do, but in that there so many different ways of doing it, depending on the situation, it’s hard to know which to reach for.
                <br>
                So let’s make it a decision tree and hopefully make it easier.

                There’s a new value in town for the CSS position property: sticky. It allows us to make elements stick when the scroll reaches a certain point. An element with position: sticky will behave like a relatively-positioned element until it reaches a specified point and then starts behaving like a statically-positioned element. In this post we’ll create a simple example to illustrate.
                <br>
                We’ll have a div container that will be a flex container and then 4 additional div elements that will be the flex items. Note we don’t have to use flexbox at all for position: sticky to work, here it’s just that flexbox happens to work great for our example.

                Performance is crucial in web applications. You can have the most beautiful and engaging website in the world, but if it does not load quickly on the browser, people would tend to skip it. It can be quite tricky to make your website perform really well. This is because of the numerous bottlenecks present in web development such as expensive JavaScript, slow web font delivery, heavy images, etc.
